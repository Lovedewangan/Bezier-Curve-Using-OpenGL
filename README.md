# Mickey Mouse Bezier Curve Renderer
Project Overview
This is an advanced OpenGL-based graphics application that renders a detailed Mickey Mouse character using Bézier curves. The application demonstrates sophisticated curve rendering techniques, interactive UI controls, and precise geometric modeling.
Key Features

Bézier Curve Rendering: Precisely constructed Mickey Mouse outline using multiple Bézier curve groups
Interactive UI Controls:

Fill Toggle: Dynamically switch between outline and filled shapes
Control Points Visualization: Show/hide control point networks


Advanced Graphics Techniques:

Custom Bézier curve calculation using Bernstein polynomials
Dynamic curve rendering with configurable line thickness
Alpha blending for smooth graphics


Modular Design: Separate curve groups for ears, face, eyes, and other details

Technical Highlights

Language: C++
Graphics Library: OpenGL (GLUT)
Curve Rendering: Mathematical Bézier curve generation
Interactive Controls: Mouse-based UI interaction
Geometric Precision: Carefully crafted control point coordinates

How to Run

Ensure you have OpenGL and GLUT installed
Compile with a C++ compiler supporting OpenGL
Execute the application to view the interactive Mickey Mouse renderer
